# AMOS Swarm

## Purpose
Multi-agent orchestration and swarm intelligence coordination. This crate manages the collective behavior of cognitive agents and enables emergent swarm intelligence.

## Components

### Swarm Orchestration
- `SwarmOrchestrator`: Central coordination hub
- `AgentRegistry`: Dynamic agent registration and discovery
- `TaskDistributor`: Intelligent task allocation
- `SwarmOptimizer`: Collective performance optimization

### Communication Infrastructure
- `MessageBus`: High-performance inter-agent messaging
- `EventStream`: System-wide event propagation
- `BroadcastChannel`: One-to-many communication
- `DirectChannel`: Point-to-point messaging

### Collective Intelligence
- `ConsensusEngine`: Multi-agent decision making
- `SwarmLearning`: Distributed learning algorithms
- `EmergentBehavior`: Pattern detection in collective actions
- `SwarmMemory`: Shared knowledge base

### Resource Management
- `ResourceAllocator`: Dynamic resource distribution
- `LoadBalancer`: Agent workload management
- `PriorityScheduler`: Task prioritization
- `ResourceMonitor`: Usage tracking and optimization

## Swarm Topologies

### Mesh Network
```rust
pub struct MeshTopology {
    agents: HashMap<AgentId, AgentHandle>,
    connections: Graph<AgentId, ConnectionStrength>,
}
```
- Full connectivity between agents
- Optimal for complex interdependent tasks
- Highest communication overhead

### Hierarchical Structure
```rust
pub struct HierarchicalTopology {
    root: AgentId,
    levels: Vec<Vec<AgentId>>,
    reporting_chains: HashMap<AgentId, AgentId>,
}
```
- Tree-like command structure
- Clear delegation paths
- Efficient for structured workflows

### Ring Formation
```rust
pub struct RingTopology {
    agents: Vec<AgentId>,
    bidirectional: bool,
}
```
- Sequential processing
- Minimal connections
- Good for pipeline operations

## Task Distribution Strategies

### Work Stealing
- Idle agents steal tasks from busy ones
- Dynamic load balancing
- Minimizes overall completion time

### Auction-Based
- Agents bid on tasks based on capability
- Market-driven resource allocation
- Optimal task-agent matching

### Predictive Assignment
- ML-based task prediction
- Preemptive resource allocation
- Minimizes task start latency

## Dependencies
- `amos-core`: Core types and traits
- `amos-agents`: Agent implementations
- `petgraph`: Graph algorithms
- `tokio`: Async runtime
- `futures`: Stream processing

## Connections
- **Depends on**: amos-core, amos-agents
- **Used by**: amos-api (external interface)
- **Integrates with**: amos-mcp (swarm control)

## Swarm Coordination Protocols

### Leader Election
```rust
pub async fn elect_leader(&self) -> Result<AgentId> {
    // Raft-based consensus for leader selection
    self.consensus_engine.elect_leader().await
}
```

### Task Consensus
```rust
pub async fn achieve_consensus(&self, proposal: Proposal) -> Result<Decision> {
    // Byzantine fault tolerant consensus
    self.consensus_engine.propose(proposal).await
}
```

## Performance Metrics
- Message latency: < 100Î¼s
- Consensus time: < 500ms for 10 agents
- Task distribution: < 10ms
- Swarm synchronization: < 1s

## Emergent Behaviors

### Flocking
- Agents naturally group for similar tasks
- Collective movement toward goals
- Dynamic formation adjustment

### Stigmergy
- Indirect coordination through environment
- Pheromone-like trail following
- Self-organizing task completion

### Collective Learning
- Shared experience propagation
- Distributed knowledge building
- Swarm-wide optimization

## Development Guidelines
1. Design for eventual consistency
2. Implement circuit breakers for fault tolerance
3. Use backpressure for flow control
4. Monitor swarm health metrics
5. Test with various swarm sizes
