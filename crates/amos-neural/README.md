# AMOS Neural

## Purpose
Advanced neural network processing and pathway management. This crate extends the core neural abstractions with sophisticated learning algorithms and pattern recognition.

## Components

### Neural Processing
- `NeuralProcessor`: High-performance pathway processing engine
- `PatternRecognition`: Identify and reinforce successful patterns
- `PathwayOptimizer`: Automatic route optimization
- `NeuralCache`: Fast pathway lookup and caching

### Learning Systems
- `HebbianLearning`: Spike-timing dependent plasticity
- `SynapticPruning`: Decay and removal of weak connections
- `PathwayEvolution`: Genetic algorithms for pathway optimization
- `MetaLearning`: Learning how to learn better

### Memory Consolidation
- `ShortTermMemory`: Recent pattern buffer
- `LongTermMemory`: Persistent pattern storage
- `MemoryConsolidation`: Transfer from short to long term
- `MemoryRetrieval`: Associative recall mechanisms

## Dependencies
- `amos-core`: Core biological abstractions
- `rayon`: Parallel processing for pathway calculations
- `ndarray`: Efficient matrix operations
- `parking_lot`: Fast synchronization primitives

## Connections
- **Depends on**: amos-core (neural foundations)
- **Used by**: amos-agents (cognitive processing)
- **Integrates with**: amos-swarm (distributed learning)

## Key Algorithms

### Hebbian Learning
```rust
// Strengthen connections that fire together
if neuron_a.fired() && neuron_b.fired() {
    let time_diff = neuron_b.spike_time - neuron_a.spike_time;
    let strength_delta = calculate_stdp(time_diff);
    pathway.strengthen(strength_delta);
}
```

### Synaptic Pruning
```rust
// Remove unused connections
if pathway.last_used.elapsed() > PRUNING_THRESHOLD {
    if pathway.strength < MIN_STRENGTH {
        network.remove_pathway(pathway.id);
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations
- SIMD operations for pathway calculations
- Lock-free pathway updates where possible
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Memory-mapped pathway storage

## Neural Patterns
- **Feedforward**: Direct signal propagation
- **Recurrent**: Feedback loops for memory
- **Lateral Inhibition**: Competition between pathways
- **Oscillatory**: Rhythmic firing patterns

## Development Guidelines
1. Maintain biological plausibility in algorithms
2. Optimize for cache-friendly access patterns
3. Use batch operations for efficiency
4. Profile pathway hotspots regularly
5. Test with realistic neural load scenarios
