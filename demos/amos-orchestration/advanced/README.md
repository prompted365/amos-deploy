# Advanced AMOS Demonstrations

Complex scenarios showcasing the full power of AMOS biological intelligence.

## Available Demos

### 1. Emergent Consensus (`emergent-consensus.rs`)
- Multi-swarm decision making
- Competing agent perspectives
- Hormonal influence on decisions
- Consensus emergence visualization

### 2. Adaptive Specialization (`adaptive-specialization.rs`)
- Agents evolving roles based on tasks
- Neural pathway optimization
- Memory formation and recall
- Performance improvement over time

### 3. Stress Response (`stress-response.rs`)
- System behavior under high load
- Cortisol-driven resource management
- Immune system activation
- Self-healing demonstrations

### 4. Complex Orchestration (`complex-orchestration.rs`)
- Multi-phase project execution
- Dynamic agent allocation
- Cross-swarm coordination
- Real-time adaptation to failures

## Performance Scenarios

### Load Testing (`load-test.rs`)
- Spawn 100+ agents simultaneously
- Measure pathway formation speed
- Monitor memory usage
- Benchmark against traditional systems

### Resilience Testing (`resilience-test.rs`)
- Random agent failures
- Network partition simulation
- Recovery time measurement
- Emergent redundancy patterns

## Visualization Tools

### 3D Neural Mesh (`neural-mesh-3d.html`)
- Three.js powered visualization
- Real-time swarm activity
- Interactive agent inspection
- Performance metrics overlay

## Running Advanced Demos
